Deep Learning Exercises: Numpy, Neural Networks, and Optimization

This repository contains solutions for the first three deep learning exercises, covering:

Numpy Basics: Implementing image processing functions and a data generator for augmentation.

Neural Networks: Building layers such as SGD optimizer, Fully Connected, ReLU, SoftMax, and Cross Entropy Loss, along with a neural network skeleton.

Optimization: Implementing optimization functions and debugging with unit tests.

These exercises provide a foundation in neural networks and optimization techniques.
